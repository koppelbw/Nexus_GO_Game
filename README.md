# Nexus_GO_Game
Another Java MVC game. 
Basically connect 5 but can place tiles anywhere. 

Game works fine, other than the graphics. I first created this game by using code from my TicTacToe game.
I then implemented this game using JButtons, but I wanted to make this game look nicer.
I attempted to get graphics working, but was unable to line everything up correctly. 
I think it has something to do with the JLabels offsetting the grid lines slightly.
